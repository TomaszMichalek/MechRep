Mechanical Repository

- Generally consists of projects made in 3D applications 
like Autodesk Inventor Proffessional or Solid Edge by Siemens.

Most of Projects are Bakery Machines (my daily workfield) made for East Europe companies.
In other repository I will push also some 3D projects but connected with progtamming.

There are also documentations of some machines like instructions, 
technical, electrical, pneumatical schemas and parts lists.
